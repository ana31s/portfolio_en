| 1. | [Integrating Classification, Survival, and Causal Inference Models for Breast Cancer Prognosis](https://github.com/ana31s/portfolio_en/tree/main/01_breast_cancer) | Using data from the Rotterdam Breast Cancer Study, I applied complementary statistical modeling frameworks to investigate recurrence and all-cause mortality. Classification models based on regularized logistic regression were used to predict binary outcomes, while Cox proportional hazards models were employed to analyze recurrence-free and overall survival. In addition, a causal inference analysis was conducted to estimate the average treatment effect of adjuvant hormonal therapy using outcome regression, with adjustment for clinically relevant confounders.  | Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, statsmodels, lifelines, Scikit-learn, Scikit-survival |
